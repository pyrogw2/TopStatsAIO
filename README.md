Your one stop shop for generating top stats. This program uses both Elite Insights Parser as well as the GW2 EI Log combiner to create a joined aggregate of multiple WvW fight logs. This is helpful for being able to see a holistic picture of your squad's performance. **AS WITH ALL ANALYTICS, PLEASE TAKE STATS AS A TOOL AND NOT AN ABSOLUTE AUTHORITY** There are always varying circumstances to a player's performance, you should never take any analytics entirely at face value.
[An example of a summary can be found here](https://wvwlogs.com/#202503052206-Log-Summary)

The primary directive of this application is to increase the user friendliness of these tools. Key features:
- Ability to easily select which logs you want to aggregate
- Ability to set a static raid time and grab logs older than a start time
- Automatically configures and uses both EliteInsightsParser and GW2EILogCombiner to generate the final `.json` to be used with TiddlyWiki
- Built-in downloader to automatically fetch the latest versions of required prerequisites

3. By default, prerequisites are downloaded to a "prerequisites" folder in the application directory:
   - Prerequisites/GW2EICLI - for the Elite Insights Parser
   - Prerequisites/GW2_EI_log_combiner - for the GW2 EI Log Combiner
4. You can choose a different location during the download process if preferred
